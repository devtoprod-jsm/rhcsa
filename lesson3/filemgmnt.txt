Links (shortcut in windows)
File - Is set of blocks containing data on storage.
inode - unique representation of a file.
hardlink - Is the name we reference when accessing files, that points to the inode directly.
Hardlinks are one way i.e they know which inodes they are associated to but not the other way inode won't.
Can have multiple hardlinks pointing to the same inode. Should be on the same partition as the inode.
Symbolic links point to the hardlink. Can reside anywhere across the file system. becomes invalid if hardlink is removed
ls -il
ln <sourcefilename> <destinationfilename> (to create hardlink)
ln -s <sourcefilename> <destinationfilename> (to create softlink)
Softlink becomes invalid is the hardlink it points to is removed.
Permissions are wide open, i.e the permissions on the hardlink are the ones that take effect.
You can only create a link on a file if you have atleast read permissions on the file.
